Proof of concept of network-capture testing on travis-ci for [gopacket](https://github.com/google/gopacket)
=====================================================================

This is a small poc for testing gopacket pf_ring capture on travis-ci.

**DO NOT USE THIS CODE**. It is coded very poorly (I just threw code at the problem, until it worked).
If this is accepted by the project, it will be rewritten into something way nicer and better and shinier.
